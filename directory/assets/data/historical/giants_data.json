According to witnesses, the structure appears to shift and change shape over time. While no one knows why this occurs, some speculate it may be due to the unique geological composition of the land or an as-yet-unknown environmental factor. Despite efforts to verify the claims through on-site observation, no conclusive evidence has been found. One witness reported seeing a faint humming noise emanating from the sculpture at night, which remains unexplained. The investigation into these claims continues, but so far, no clear explanation has been uncovered.",
