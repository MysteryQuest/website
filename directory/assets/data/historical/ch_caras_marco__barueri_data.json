      "enhanced_description": "The Roswell Inn is a local business in Roswell, New Mexico, that operates as an inn, hotel, and motel at 2101 N Main St. According to the account of local residents and visitors, the building has been in operation since at least the early 20th century. Witnesses report seeing unusual lights and orbs during the night, which some attribute to paranormal activity. However, these claims remain unexplained. Despite efforts to verify the reports through local authorities and other research, no concrete evidence has been found. The building's history is shrouded in mystery, with many speculating about its connection to extraterrestrial life or government cover-ups. Further investigation is needed to shed light on this enigmatic establishment.",
