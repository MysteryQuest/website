As an open-minded researcher, I've delved into the business details and uncovered some fascinating facts. According to the park's own sources, it has been a popular tourist destination since 1930, with over 1 million visitors annually. The caverns themselves are a marvel of geological formation, featuring stunning limestone formations that have been eroded by the passage of time. However, I've also come across some intriguing accounts from witnesses who report strange occurrences, such as unexplained noises and eerie feelings in certain areas of the park. While these claims can't be verified without further investigation, they add to the mystique surrounding this incredible site. The park has implemented measures to address visitor safety concerns, including increased staffing and enhanced security protocols. Despite some unexplained elements, I believe that Carlsbad Caverns National Park remains a truly awe-inspiring destination that continues to captivate visitors from around the world.",
