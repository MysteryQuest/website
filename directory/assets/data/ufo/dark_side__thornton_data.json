      "type": "UFO Sighting",
      "description": "A breakthrough in sustainable construction technology has been achieved by researchers at ETH Zurich, who have developed a new living building material that effectively pulls carbon dioxide from the air. According to the account of Dr. Maria Rodriguez, one of the lead researchers, this innovative material could potentially be used in large-scale applications. However, remains unexplained and requires further investigation. Witnesses report seeing strange lights hovering around a construction site during the development phase, which some speculate might be related to the project's progress. While these sightings are intriguing, they remain anecdotal and require additional verification. The scientific community will need to take a closer look at this discovery before making any claims about its potential applications.",
