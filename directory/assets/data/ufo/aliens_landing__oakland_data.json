      "description": "A recent James Webb Space Telescope observation suggests that the exoplanet K2-18b may not be teeming with life after all. The data, released earlier this year, reveals a unique feature on this distant world: its atmosphere is capable of supporting liquid water and complex organic molecules - conditions necessary for life as we know it. According to eyewitnesses from NASA's Dragonfly mission, which landed on K2-18b in 2023, the observations indicate that the planet's surface temperature may be too cold for liquid water to exist. However, remains unexplained by current scientific understanding of atmospheric and geological processes.",
