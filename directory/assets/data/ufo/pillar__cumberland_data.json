According to the account from local residents and business owners, the hotel has been operational for several years and seems to have received positive reviews. However, some witnesses report experiencing unexplained occurrences such as ghostly apparitions and strange noises. Despite these reports, there is no concrete evidence to support supernatural claims. The hotel's management has not provided any information on its history or how it came to be. Investigation into the hotel's past remains unfruitful. Unusual details include a peculiar smell emanating from the rooms and a mysterious symbol etched onto the wall in one of the guest rooms. While some consider these events inexplicable, others remain skeptical. A thorough investigation has not uncovered any definitive answers, leaving the mystery surrounding the Daffodil Hotel & Spa to continue.",
