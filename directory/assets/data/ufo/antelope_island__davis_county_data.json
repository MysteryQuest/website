Researchers claim to have found evidence on Nikumaroro Island in the Pacific Ocean that points to a possible explanation for her vanishing. According to eyewitnesses who reported seeing Earhart's plane go missing, she was last seen taking off from Rarotonga Airport before disappearing into thin air.

The witness account describes a metallic spherical object flying eastward above the water surface from the west side of Shayukou Reservoir. However, the object's ability to hover and move behind trees despite no wind suggests it may be capable of extraordinary propulsion or manipulation. While the sighting remains unverified, witnesses report that the sphere reappeared in the south after being observed for a few minutes, sparking curiosity about its intentions. Further investigation is warranted to determine the source of this phenomenon.",
