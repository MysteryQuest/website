Witnesses report that the restaurant's exterior has been renovated recently, and a new sign was installed in front of the building. While some argue that this may be due to increased foot traffic or marketing efforts, others point out that the renovation occurred shortly after Hernandez stepped down as owner. The restaurant has received positive reviews from locals and visitors alike, with many praising its authentic flavors and generous portions.
