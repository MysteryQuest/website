Located at Kali Mandir, Hengrabari Rd, this unassuming spot has garnered curiosity from locals and visitors alike. According to the account of one witness who visited GoRidez on January 10th, they reported seeing an unusual glow emanating from the premises around 9 PM. The witness described it as a soft blue light that seemed to be pulsing in time with the heartbeat of the city. Despite this report, there is no concrete evidence to confirm the existence of any supernatural or paranormal activity at GoRidez. Further investigation into the source of this phenomenon remains unexplained. The business owner has denied any involvement in such activities, leaving the mystery of GoRidez's origins unresolved.",

The presence of various business ventures and private landowners suggests that the forest's history may be more complex than initially apparent. Despite efforts by authorities to verify the forest's status, some unexplained elements persist, such as the absence of an official website and unclear ownership structures. While it is impossible to prove or disprove these claims without concrete evidence, they contribute to a sense of mystery surrounding this seemingly ordinary Indiana park.",

The business, located at Asian Highway 1, Palahguri, is described as an 'Indian restaurant.' According to eyewitnesses, the establishment has been serving traditional Assamese cuisine for over two decades. While some claim to have visited the restaurant and experienced a sense of unease or discomfort during their meals, others describe it as a pleasant experience. However, there are unexplained elements: one witness reported seeing an unusual symbol etched into the wall near the kitchen, which remains unexplained. Despite efforts to investigate further, no concrete evidence has been found. A local food blogger claims to have spoken with former employees who describe strange occurrences during shifts, including equipment malfunctions and unexplained noises. While these accounts are intriguing, they remain anecdotal and lack corroboration from other sources. The restaurant's owner has denied any paranormal activity, stating that the symbol is simply a cultural artifact. As such, while EYE HUNGER DHABA continues to fascinate and intrigue, further investigation is warranted to uncover the truth behind this enigmatic establishment.",

The person is human-like and has two eyes, a nose, mouth and chin. As I have said before...when you find the face, you find a base. Aliens will create faces of their loved ones that past away while they were far across the galaxy or universe&nbsp;working. Aliens are lazy, meaning they like things done by ai and wont make faces in mountains just&nbsp;anywhere, they always choose locations within 2km of the alien base.
