This revelation remains unexplained and raises more questions than it answers. The researchers point to eyewitness testimony from geologists who claim to have seen the structures firsthand, stating 'we can't ignore the evidence.' While some attribute this to misinterpretation or exaggeration, others argue that there's still too much uncertainty at play. As one researcher puts it, 'the more we learn, the more questions arise.'
