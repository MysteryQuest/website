According to a recent collaboration between conservationists and scientists, they are attempting to extract DNA from well-preserved remains found in caves on the South Island. However, while this breakthrough offers hope for studying the moa up close, it also raises questions about the methods used and potential contamination risks. Witnesses report that the team had to work with a local Maori tribe to gain access to the caves, highlighting the complex interplay between traditional knowledge and modern science. Despite these challenges, researchers remain optimistic about the project's prospects.",

According to eyewitnesses who claim to have visited the store during its hours of operation, there is an unexplained 'glowing' or 'radiant' light emanating from within the premises. Despite attempts at investigation and verification, no concrete evidence has been found to support this claim. Some witnesses report seeing a faint, pulsing glow on the windows, while others describe feeling an unusual energy or vibration during their visits. While some have speculated that the store's ambiance might be responsible for these observations, most remain unexplained. Further research is needed to shed light on this mysterious occurrence.",
