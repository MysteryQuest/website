According to these accounts, the entities have been spotted near Mount Everest and other extreme environments, sparking speculation about their origins and capabilities. While some details remain unexplained, such as their ability to withstand intense temperatures and radiation, others suggest a sophisticated technological presence. The investigation is ongoing, with NASA seeking input from experts in microbiology, physics, and astrophysics.
