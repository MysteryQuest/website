According to witnesses report, the current site was hastily abandoned without notice, leaving behind scattered belongings and a sense of unease. The owners claim no knowledge of the reason for the sudden change in location, but some speculate about potential health or environmental concerns. Despite efforts to verify the information through interviews with local residents and business acquaintances, several inconsistencies and unexplained elements remain. For instance, one witness reported seeing a peculiar symbol etched into the ground near the construction site, while another claimed to have encountered an unusual humming noise emanating from the area. As such, this case remains shrouded in mystery, leaving room for further investigation and speculation.",
