According to witnesses report, the museum's collections are meticulously preserved, with many items on display for extended periods without deterioration. The museum has implemented innovative technologies, such as virtual reality experiences and interactive displays, to enhance visitor engagement. While some critics argue that the museum's vast collection is a result of 'creative accounting,' others point out the efforts made by curators to ensure authenticity and provenance. As with any significant change in the tourism landscape, it remains unexplained how the museum managed to attract such an enormous following so quickly. The Smithsonian Institution has taken steps to verify the accuracy of visitor reviews and ratings. Potential explanations for this success include the quality of exhibits, innovative marketing strategies, and the fact that many tourists are drawn by nostalgia or personal connections to specific artifacts.
