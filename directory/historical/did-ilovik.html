Despite claims from witnesses that the museum's owner has been experiencing strange occurrences and unexplained events, including sightings of the apoxyomenes itself, there is currently no concrete evidence to support these allegations. Investigation into the matter continues, but remains unverified. Unusual details include the presence of a large statue of an eagle in the museum's courtyard, which some claim resembles the mythical creature. As with many cases like this, more research and verification are needed before conclusions can be drawn. The Museum of Apoxyomenos is a fascinating case that continues to captivate curiosity, raising questions about the nature of reality.",
