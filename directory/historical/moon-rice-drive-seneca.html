Located at 11011 N Radio Station Rd, Seneca, SC 29678, USA, this store appears to be a discount store and clothing retailer. According to witnesses report, it is open during business hours and offers a wide range of products. However, one witness claimed that the store's interior features an unusual layout, with shelves of clothing arranged in a seemingly intentional manner that defies conventional retail organization. Additionally, some customers have reported receiving suspiciously low prices for items. The store remains unexplained, with no apparent connection to any local business or entity. Further investigation is warranted to determine the true nature and purpose of this enigmatic store.",

The Spot on the Alley, an American restaurant and bar, has been a staple at 122 Ram Cat Alley since its opening. According to witnesses report, the establishment appears unassuming, with no visible signs of distress or unusual activity. However, locals claim that strange occurrences have been reported by patrons, including unexplained noises, flickering lights, and ghostly apparitions. Despite these claims, there is no concrete evidence to support these assertions. Attempts at investigation have yielded limited results, and the owner remains tight-lipped about the matter. One witness described a photograph taken on a particular night as 'out of focus,' but this was later revealed to be a misinterpretation of the lighting conditions. The truth behind The Spot on the Alley's enigmatic atmosphere remains unexplained.",
