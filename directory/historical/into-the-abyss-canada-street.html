According to eyewitnesses (a visitor who wished to remain anonymous), the park seems to be surrounded by a mysterious aura that makes it difficult to leave once entered. This phenomenon has been reported for several years, despite attempts at investigation and verification by local authorities. While some attribute this to natural causes or human error, others believe it could be evidence of an unknown or unexplained entity.
