Witnesses report that the business seems legitimate, with a visible office and staff. However, one witness noted that the company's website lacks clear information about their tours, leading to speculation about potential inconsistencies. Despite efforts to verify the company's credentials, some questions remain unanswered. Further investigation into the case is warranted to uncover more information.

According to accounts from eyewitnesses, the museum's founder, Ivan Grohovac, has been collecting rare and historic devices for over two decades. However, some have questioned the authenticity of certain artifacts, with one visitor recalling seeing a 1970s-era computer that didn't match the description provided by the museum staff. While the museum remains unexplained in terms of its collection's origins, it is clear that Ivan Grohovac had an impressive knowledge of technology and was passionate about sharing his passion with others. Despite some discrepancies, the museum has been verified through multiple sources, including local historians and experts in computer history.
