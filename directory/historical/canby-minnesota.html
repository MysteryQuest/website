The witnesses report that these connections led to unexplained occurrences such as missing staff members and strange noises in the hallways at night. While the inn's manager has attributed these events to 'staff fatigue' and 'renovations,' some guests have come forward with claims of paranormal activity, including sightings of ghostly apparitions and unexplained cold spots. Despite an investigation by local authorities, no concrete evidence was found to support these allegations.
