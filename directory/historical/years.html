According to witnesses, a significant increase in visitors occurred between 2018 and 2020, with some claiming it was due to increased tourism efforts following a major infrastructure development project. However, this sudden surge remains unexplained by official records or external factors. Further investigation has not yielded conclusive evidence. Despite these discrepancies, park officials have attributed the rise to improved marketing campaigns and increased awareness of the park's attractions. While some speculate about potential paranormal explanations, most experts believe the phenomenon can be attributed to human error or an honest increase in visitor traffic. The true causes behind this anomaly remain a mystery, leaving room for speculation while maintaining journalistic integrity.",

According to witnesses report, the museum's founder, Bob Smith, was instrumental in preserving the region's rich history and promoting education about its role in the energy industry. However, some argue that the museum's significance goes beyond its educational value, with some claiming it as a 'ghost town' due to its lack of economic activity since its closure. Despite claims of supernatural occurrences, no concrete evidence has been found to support these assertions.
