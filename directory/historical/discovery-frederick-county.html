The witness report suggests that these events may be related to strange noises and movements that occur in the store's storage areas at night. While no concrete evidence has been found, the eyewitness testimony remains unexplained. Further investigation is needed to determine if there are any underlying causes for this phenomenon. It is also worth noting that Wegmans has consistently maintained a high level of customer service and staff training, which could potentially be influencing public perception of the store.",

An investigation was conducted to verify this information, but no conclusive evidence was found. The report also mentions that customers have reported seeing strange lights and shadows near the store at night. While these claims are anecdotal and lack concrete evidence, they add to the mystique surrounding Costco. Unusual details include the fact that the store's website displays a map of its physical location with an unusual marker indicating a nearby intersection, which is not visible on any other maps.
