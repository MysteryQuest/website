Located at 4 E Patrick St, the cafe and coffee shop claims to be the oldest continuously operating restaurant in the county, with an estimated age of over 200 years. According to eyewitnesses, the building has been vacant for several months prior to its reopening, sparking rumors about potential renovations or even closure. The source reports that a local business owner, known for their involvement in community projects, claims to have no knowledge of any renovation plans and denies any involvement in the sudden closure. Despite initial skepticism from the community, some witnesses report seeing strange lights emanating from the building at night. Investigation attempts have been made to verify these claims, but so far, no concrete evidence has been found. Remains unexplained.",
