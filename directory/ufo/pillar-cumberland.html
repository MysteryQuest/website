According to witnesses report, the cave's entrance features intricate stone carvings that depict scenes of nature and mythological creatures, adding to its mystique. While some may attribute these carvings' origins to ancient pagan rituals, no concrete evidence supports this theory. The cave remains unexplained, with no clear explanation for the carvings' purpose or meaning.

The source notes that while there have been some attempts at investigation and verification, more research is needed to understand the significance of this finding.

According to the account of a recent reviewer, who claims to have witnessed the hotel's staff seemingly 'vanishing' into thin air during peak hours, while guests report experiencing inexplicable, unexplained phenomena such as sudden gusts of wind and unseasonable temperature drops. Witnesses report that the hotel's staff seem to be aware of these events, but their behavior is anything but normal. The source notes that some staff members have reported feeling an intense sense of unease or 'being watched' during these times, despite there being no signs of external disturbance. While this account remains unexplained, it raises questions about the nature of reality and the human experience. Further investigation into this phenomenon is warranted, but for now, Daffodil Hotel & Spa remains a fascinating enigma.",
