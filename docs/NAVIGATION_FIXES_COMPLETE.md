# Navigation and API Error Fixes - Complete

## Issues Fixed

### 🔧 **CORS Error Resolution**
**Problem**: `Failed to fetch` errors when loading header/footer components from separate files
- Error: `Access to fetch at 'file:///includes/footer.html' from origin 'null' has been blocked by CORS policy`

**Solution**: 
- Converted dynamic file loading to inline HTML generation
- Modified `navigation.js` to include header/footer HTML directly in JavaScript functions
- Removed dependency on separate `.html` files that caused CORS issues
- Added path detection for subdirectories to handle logo path correctly

### 🔧 **Google Sheets API Error Handling**
**Problem**: 403 error from Google Sheets API causing crashes
- Error: `Failed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 403`

**Solution**:
- Added comprehensive error handling in `fetchTopMysteries()` function
- Created `showFallbackContent()` function with sample mystery data
- Graceful degradation when API is unavailable
- Better user feedback with meaningful sample content instead of empty sections
